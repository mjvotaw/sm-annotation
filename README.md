# SMEditor

This is a fork of [SMEditor](https://tillvit.github.io/smeditor), created to aid in building a database of good step annotation data for doing some Smart Math Stuff with it in the near future.

## Update 11/26/2024

I'm taking the site down now, as it hasn't actually been used in a few months. Thank you to everyone who helped out with this. I didn't actually end up collecting a ton of data, but what I did collect was pretty helpful in understanding some issues with the existing annotation algorithm. As promised, I'll get the data packaged up into something potentially useful and add it to this repo some time in the next few weeks.
